# Planning an Exhibition: Where to from here

The Khirbet el-Ra'i Exhibition Project is still in its infancy, and unfortunately, we experienced some minor setbacks due to CoVid-19. At the beginning of Semester One, we had planned to begin work on launching the exhibition. To do this, we needed to gain access to the new museum space - which has not been possible. Hopefully as restrictions ease over the coming months, we will be able to access to the new space and make progress in this area. The following is an outline of project goals over the second half of the year.

## The Exhibition

   * Establish the exhibition's 'story' and the perspective from which it will be told
   * Work with a designer to curate the space
   * Begin creating textual and visual content for the digital screens
   * Create item labels 
   * Begin work on a 3D model of the Khirbet el-Rai photogrammetry, which will create interactivity in our exhibition space

## The Catalogue

   * Continue to research and produce content for the catalogue
   * Once we receive the professional item photography, begin curating the design and aesthetic of the catalogue
   * Organise the forwards, relative biblical quotes, and snippets of past student experiences to frame the archaeology from a student perspective
   * Publication!

## A Digital Space

We floated the idea of creating a digital space to accompany our exhibition to promote engagement and interactivity with a broader audience. A digital space may also allow our exhibition to be more accessible for visitors with disabilities. I approached an experienced software developer, and we should be able to create an online space for our exhibition later in the year.
