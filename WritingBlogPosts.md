# Blog Posts

As the Khirbet el-Ra'i Exhibition Project is a longer-term project, we needed to produce 'submission' content for PACE. We decided to create blog posts for the MQ Ancient History Blog. At least one blog based on the project, and one blog as a 'curators pick' to showcase some of the exciting items in our exhibition. The 'Curators Pick' enabled us to further engage unit themes of significance and communicating history. Creating blog posts also enabled us to practice writing academic topics for a non-academic audience, which is a skill I must hone for the catalogue essays. 

Creating these blog posts required several hours of meetings with Dr Brian Ballsun-Stanton, the faculty of Arts' Solutions Architect. To publish our blog posts, we needed to learn to write Markdown, how to use and work collaboratively in Atom, and how to push our work onto the Ancient History Git repository for publication. These blog posts will serve as marketing for our exhibition in the lead up to the launch in 2021. Our posts will have a staggered publishing schedule from July through to December.

The two blog posts I have created for the MQ Ancient History Blog are:

   * [A History of the Ancient Israel Program](AHistory.md)
   * [Curators Pick: The 'Lamp-and-Bowl' Foundation Deposit](Curatorspick.md)

## Researching the Blog Posts

### A History of the Ancient Israel Program

Collating the information for this blog post required different research techniques traditionally employed by the ancient historian. I began with my own and my cohort's shared experiences with the program through the 2020 Khirbet el-Ra'i dig. Then, Gil provided me with reports and executive summaries he had produced for the Program's donors from 2015 - 2018. These reports were produced sporadically, so I searched out Macquarie blog posts which mentioned any of the achievements the Program has accomplished. At this point there were still large gaps in my research, so I collated a series of questions for Gil Davis, the program director (and as I discovered, Founder) to answer. 

### Curators Pick: The 'Lamp-and-Bowl' Deposit

The research of this blog post employed traditional research techniques - searching through primary sources and accompanying research.
