# A History of Macquarie's Ancient Israel Program

In the glory of the sunrise on the 27th of January 2020, 32 students from Macquarie University began their hike up the sloping hill of Khirbet el-Ra'i to start their second full day of excavation. With sore limbs and a sense of excitement permeating through the group, they began to wonder - *what would we find today?* By the end of three weeks of excavation, that question could be answered with an array of incredible treasures. An intact foundation deposit, a bronze bracelet, a bronze smiting god figurine, and a small animal figure were amongst the ancient trove of this season’s uncovered finds. The opportunity for Macquarie students to learn excavation methods on a historically vibrant biblical site is just one of the opportunities provided by the Ancient Israel Program, which is founded and directed by Macquarie’s own Dr Gil Davis.

The Ancient Israel Program was founded in 2012, with goals to:

   * Broaden the ancient Israel offering in Macquarie’s already diverse department of Ancient history

   * Advocate for the inclusion of ancient Israel in the school curriculum and;

   * Create awareness and promote the education of ancient Israel to the general public.

Through the Ancient Israel Program, the Ancient Israel Outreach Fellowship was established. The Outreach Fellowship succeeded in reintroducing ancient Israel back into the Ancient History School Curriculum. The teaching of ancient Israel in schools was further supported by the Outreach program with online resources for classrooms. Teachers were also able to enhance their own historical knowledge and passion with first-hand experience in Israel, sponsored by the Ancient Israel Program.  

In 2013, The Ancient Israel Program partnered with the Tel Aviv University in Israel. This collaboration created the opportunity for Macquarie Students to excavate at the site of Tel Azekah. By 2017, over 150 Macquarie students and HSC teachers had travelled to Israel to experience the archaeology ‘in-situ’. In 2016 the Program strengthened its Israeli ties by establishing an annual Biblical Archaeology and Summer Ulpan course with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. These courses afforded Macquarie University students the extraordinary opportunity to experience Ancient Israel from the pinnacle of Masada and the City of David rather than just through books and lecture theatres.

In 2018, the burgeoning relationship between Macquarie University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem fostered by the Ancient Israel Program bloomed with the establishment of a jointly coordinated excavation at the site of Khirbet el-Ra'i. Co-directed by Dr Kyle Keimer (Macquarie University), Professor Yosef Garfinkel (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem) and Mr Saar Ganor (Israel Antiquities Authority), Khirbet el-Ra'i promised to be an exciting site with its known 12th, 11th and 10th c. CE settlements. After four seasons of joint excavation, Khirbet el-Ra'i was identified as the biblical town Ziklag. Ziklag is a town closely associated with King David in the biblical tradition, with the town being given to David by the Philistine King in 1 Samuel 30 before his enthronement.

> So on that day Achish gave him Ziklag, and it has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since. 
1 Samuel 26:6

During the 2019 winter season, an on-site chemistry lab was introduced led by Macquarie’s Dr Sophia Aharonovich. The chemistry lab not only allowed for real-time sample testing, but it also provided an innovative and unparalleled opportunity for Macquarie students to expand their archaeological skills. All Macquarie students who participated in the 2019 and 2020 excavations undertook sampling and analysis training in the field, meaning all students contributed to our understanding of human activity at Khirbet el-Ra'i and future research.

The opportunities afforded to both students and teachers through the Ancient Israel Program would not be possible without the generosity of donors.
