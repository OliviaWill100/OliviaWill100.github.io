# Blog Posts
As the Khirbet el-Rai exhibition project is a longer-term project, we needed to produce 'submissible' content for PACE. We decided to create blog posts for the MQ Ancient History Blog. At least one blog based on the project, and one blog as a 'curators pick' to showcase some of the exciting items in our exhibit. The 'Curators Pick' enabled us to further engage unit themes of significance and public history. 

Creating these blog posts required several hours of meetings with Dr Brian Ballsun-Stanton, the faculty of Arts' Solutions Architect. To publish our blog posts, we needed to learn Markdown, how to use and work collaboratively in Atom, and how to push our work onto the Ancient History Git repository for publication. These blog posts will serve as marketing for our exhibition in the lead up to the launch in 2021. Our posts will have a staggered publishing schedule from July through to December.

My two blog posts are:
   * [A History of the Ancient Israel Program](/Users/oliviacaplin/Documents/GitHub/OliviaWill100.github.io/_posts/AHistory.md)
   * [Curators Pick: The 'Lamp-and-Bowl' Foundation Deposit](/Users/oliviacaplin/Documents/GitHub/OliviaWill100.github.io/_posts/Curatorspick.md)
