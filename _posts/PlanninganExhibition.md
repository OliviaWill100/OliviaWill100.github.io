# Planning an Exhibition: Where to from here
The Khirbet el-Rai exhibition project is still in its infancy, and unfortunately, we experienced some minor setbacks due to CoVid-19. At the beginning of Semester One, we had planned to begin work on the physical aspects of launching the exhibition. To do this, we needed to gain access to the new space - which has not been possble. Hopefully as restrictions ease, we will be able to accomplish the following tasks:
   * Work with a designer to curate the space
   * Begin creating textual and visual content for the digital screens
   * Create item labels 
   * Begin work on a 3D model of the Khirbet el-Rai photogrammetry

In the meantime and over the following few months, I will continue to research and produce content for the catalogue. We will be recieving the professional item photography soon, which will allow us to curate the aesthetics of the catalogue layout.

## A Digital Space
We floated the idea of creating a digital space to accompany our exhibition to promote engagement and interactivity with a broader audience. I approached an experienced software developer, and we should be able to create an online space for our exhibition later in the year.
