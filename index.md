# The Project

From 2018 until 2020, Macquarie University has partnered with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to excavate the ancient site of Khirbet el-Rai. These excavations led to exciting discoveries of Canaanite material culture, as well as receiving significant press coverage over its identification as [Ziklag](https://www.heritagedaily.com/2020/04/rare-figurines-uncovered-at-lost-biblical-city/127574). During the final season in 2020, Dr Gil Davis began discussions with Professor Yosef Garfinkel (Co-director of the dig, and Professor at the Hebrew University) and Saar Ganor (from the Israel Antiquity Authority) for Macquarie University to host an exhibition of the important finds in the newly built museum. And thus, the Khirbet el-Rai Exhibition Project was born. 

The Khirbet el-Rai Exhibition Project is a student-led project with two primary goals:

1. Launch an exhibition in early 2021 
2. Create and publish an accompanying catalogue 

This is a 12-18-month project. The following blog posts will detail my role in this project, the work which will be published, and the work yet to be done.
